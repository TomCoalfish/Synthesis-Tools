# Embedded VCV Rack
* The goal is to modify VCV Rack to load headless
* Can load patches and use them headless
* It already can run headles sbut I want to embed it
* There is already a plugin called Cardinal but I don't want plugins 

# LV2 Plugin
* Very rudimentated 
* Very primitive
* Can load them but there is no explanation of many things like the URID 
* Don't know where in LV2 you start the GUI yet
* Not very good examples anywhere

# Ladspa plugin
* Much easier to load than LV2
* Nobody makes them anymore
* But historically there are still quite alot of them that can be useful



# LuaJIT
* Embedded command REPL

# GNU Octave
* It is in DSP-1
* You can use DSP-1 with Stk too
