# TStk
Templated Synthesis Toolkit

# Almost finished
* Working on it
 
# SIMD, Fixed point
* The idea is that with the templates you can be able to use vectorizer classes
* I have a fixed point class that is like a floating point number
* You just make the template use the class
* For SIMD it needs some work on Stk frames to make it compatible with the classes
* I have SSE and AVX 
* Possible library you can use like Vc with Gcc
