# TStk
* Experimental Templated version of Stk

# SIMD
* The template was experiment to vectorize Stk with SIMD
* The library I am using is Vectorclass version 2

# Aligned Allocator
* StkFrames needs to be changed to use aligned memory allocation for SIMD

# Vectorclass version 2
* Now experiment with using Stk with Vc Vec4f and Vc Vec8f
* Might have to change some things 
* That was the goal of templating it 

# Fixedpoint
* I have some fixed point class but not everything is going to work
* Not sure yet if it works
