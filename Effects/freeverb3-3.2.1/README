------------------------------------------------
Freeverb3 Impulse Response Processor (freeverb3)
------------------------------------------------

Freeverb3 is a signal processing library.

This library includes many types of audio processing effects and signal
generators. The linear feedback shift register (LFSR) maximum length
sequence (MLS) generator, multiple types of high quality mono and stereo reverb
effects, an multi slot impulse response processor, multiband hardknee and softknee
compressor and limiter, a stereo enhancer, a limiter and a lot of
types of infinite impulse respose (IIR) and finite impulse response (FIR)
filters are available.

The convolution reverb algorithm is highly optimized
for x86 processors by using hand optimized codes of 3DNow!/SSE/SSE3/AVX/FMA/FMA4
(single precision), SSE2/SSE4/AVX/FMA/FMA4 (double precision), which can be
used for zero latency realtime sound effect processing. This library supports
any environment which GCC supports including x86/ppc/sparc. 

This library includes audacious effect plugins and sample programs,
which can be used to test the sound effect easily.
Please report any bugs or advices.

The hand-optimized SIMD codes for some CPUs are included in this library,
which will provide fast convolution processing.

Dependencies of libfreeverb3
============================

* FFTW3 [http://www.fftw.org/]
  This library needs at least one precision version
  (single or double or long double) of fftw3 libraries,
  which are called fftw3f or fftw3 or fftw3l.
  fftw-3.1.2 was tested.

Dependencies of programs
========================

Sample programs      : libsndfile
Jack sample programs : libsndfile jack
                       (The configdb subset library is included in jack dir,
		       so jack programs do not depend on audacious.)
audacious            : libsndfile audacious glib2 GTK+3 gthread pango

* libsndfile [http://www.mega-nerd.com/libsndfile/]
  libsndfile-1.0.17 was tested.

* jack [http://jackaudio.org/]
  jackd version 0.101.1 was tested.

* audacious [https://audacious-media-player.org/]
  audacious >= 3.5 is required. Only GTK3 version is supported.

* GTK+ [http://www.gtk.org/]
  gtk-3.x >= 3.0.0 is required.

* glib2 [http://www.gtk.org/]
  glib-2.x >= 2.6.0 is required.

* gthread, pango

If you are building this from the source repository sources,
you will need the following tools:

* autotools (autoconf, automake and libtool)
* autogen

configure OPTIONS
=================

See configure --help.

SIMD optimization codes for the impulse convolution
===================================================

binutils >= 2.19.51.0.12 is required to build SIMD codes including AMD FMA4.

3DNow! uses primitive 3DNow! codes.
This can be used on AMD CPUs which have 3DNow! instructions.
(K6-2, Athlon, ...)

SSE can be used on Intel or AMD CPUs which have SSE instrunctions.
(PentiumIII, ..., AthlonXP, Athlon64, ...)
SSE is used on x86_64/amd64.

SSE2 can be used on Intel or AMD CPUs which have SSE2 instrunctions.
(Pentium4, ..., Opteron, ...)
SSE2 is enabled on x86_64/amd64.

Use --disable-x86simd to disable x86 SIMD codes on x86/x86_64/amd64.

Supported instructions:
single floating point | 3DNow!, SSE, SSE3, AVX, FMA3, FMA4
double floating ponit | SSE2, SSE4, AVX, FMA3, FMA4
