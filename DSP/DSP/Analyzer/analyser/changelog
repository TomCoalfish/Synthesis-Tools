r2:

	Notes:
	-Waveform:
		-added waveform viewer, to switch between launching waveform viewer or level meter, comment out the relevant option
		in the main function at the bottom of main.
		-waveform viewer only reads directly from buffer at the moment, does not request samples from library
		-waveform viewer is drawn with points and lines
	-Truncate function:
		-added two functions, one to return the index in the sample at where the sample first goes from negative to positive,
		and one which should return an array of the original sample which has been truncated to the first negative to positive section.
	
	Known bugs:
	-Currently the truncate function doesn't return the correct chunk of memory, appears to return the same chunk that you send it
	
	Fixes:
	-One Poll Peak average now working with AnalysisDLL struct.
	-Can now calculate n channels gui without needing to pass in which channel you are from.

r1:

	Notes:
	-first push of code
	
	Known bugs/Areas for improvement:
	-One Poll Peak average not working properly due to AnalysisDLL struct not retaining average value between calls.
	-Began implementing n channels gui, need to fix AnalysisDLL struct so that we can calculate multiple channels 
	values without having to pass in the current channel as a parameter.
